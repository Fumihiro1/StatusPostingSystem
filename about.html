    <ul>
        <li>Implemented better layouts, buttons and form functionality with some basic css knowledge. 
        <li>Struggled mainly with getting the database saving and retrieval right. </li>
        <li>Next time, I'd like to focus more on creating a nicer UI, as the assignment itself </br>
	was extremely helpful and quite fun to program.</li>
        <li>Learned some features of HTML and CSS from w3schools.com.</li>
